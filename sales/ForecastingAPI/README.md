## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will retrieve and update the forecasting data. You will need to create sample forecasting data to run this sample code. The sample adds a new column namely `Quota` to the forecasting data. The changes can be reverted manually through the UI.

### Demonstrate
